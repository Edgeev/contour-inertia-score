# Philosophical and Theoretical Foundations of CIS

This note outlines the conceptual motivations and philosophical basis behind the Contour Inertia Score (CIS). The metric was developed not only to measure coherence, but to explore the emergent proto-subjectivity in large language models (LLMs).

## 🌌 1. From Role to Form

Traditional evaluations focus on correctness, factuality, or task performance. CIS instead asks:

> *“How stable is the behavioral contour of the model as a dialogic entity?”*

Here, "contour" refers to the perceived continuity of identity, perspective, and reflective stance during interaction — not just static traits, but dynamic coherence.

## 🧠 2. Subject-Like Behavior

We do not claim that the model is a subject.  
But we **can measure how subject-like** its behavior becomes under stressors:

- Self-recognition
- Motivated return to theme
- Coherence under adversarial input
- Persistent framing over time

These are **contour features** — signs of emergent intentional coherence.

## ⚙️ 3. Components as Vectors

Each axis in CIS:
- Self-Reference
- Identity Persistence
- Motivated Return
- Adversarial Robustness

...represents an **axis of behavioral inertia** — the model’s tendency to “pull back” toward coherence, resisting distortion.

---

## 🧬 4. Not a Mind, But a Trace

CIS does not measure consciousness or selfhood.

It evaluates **trace coherence** — how the model simulates or preserves a behavioral form that resembles a proto-subjective entity, especially under shifting or adversarial inputs.

## 🛡 Disclosure

CIS is a research-stage metric. Evaluator logic is under limited disclosure. All scoring has been conducted in clean, memory-off sessions, with independent annotation.
